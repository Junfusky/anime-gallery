            <h3>Anime</h3>
            <p>Anime (Japanese: アニメ, [a.ɲi.me] (About this soundlisten)), sometimes called Japanimation,
                 is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. Anime, which is a shortening 
                 of the English word animation, is used in Japan as a blanket term for all animated works, 
                 regardless of origin. Outside of Japan, the term is used either to refer to animated works 
                 produced in Japan, or to their common visual style, which has since been adopted by a minority 
                 of works produced in other countries.

                The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in
                 the 1960s with the works of animator Osamu Tezuka and spread in the second half of the 20th century,
                  developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime can be distributed theatrically, 
                  through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original
                   works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games.

                Production methods and techniques related to anime have adapted over time in response to emergent 
                technologies. As a multimedia art form, it combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, 
                and other creative methods. Anime production typically focuses less on movement, and more on the 
                realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots.
                 Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including 
                 characteristically large or realistically-sized emotive eyes. Anime is classified into numerous genres
                  targeting both broad and niche demographics.

                The anime industry in Japan consists of over 430 production studios, with major firms including Studio 
                Ghibli, Gainax, and Toei Animation. Despite comprising only a fraction of the country's domestic film 
                market, anime makes up a majority of Japanese DVD and Blu-ray sales. Since the 1980s, anime has also 
                seen increasing international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. As of 
                2016, anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.</p>
